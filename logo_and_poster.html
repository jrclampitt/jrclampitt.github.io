	Created using Illustrator, both the logo in the bottom left corner and the
poster itself were made with the idea of a company one might have twenty years
in the future. The one in question operates in a future where manual input is a
thing of the past, and 3D models can be created with just our brainwaves. The
aesthetic is a nod to vaporwave and its criticism of consumerism, which I found
to be fitting irony for an advertisement about fueling oneâ€™s desires for material
objects. Twenty years seems like long enough to allow the bastardization of the
movement to be far enough removed from its original meaning.
