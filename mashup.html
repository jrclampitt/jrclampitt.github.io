	The culmination of the semester, this is the piece I take most pride in. It started as an abstract pallete-knife painting which was heavily processed in Photoshop. Then, using a 3D model I had created in Rhino in conjunction with its rendering capabilities, I converted those images into vector using Illustrator. The final piece was composed together using Photoshop, tweaking hue and saturation, and adding masks and additional filters. The nature of the piece is non-representational, and aims to evoke in the viewer either fascination or discomfort at the strange and otherworldly forms floating through this neon abyss.
